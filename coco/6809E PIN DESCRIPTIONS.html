<P>Sixteen pins are used to output address information from the MPU onto =
the=20
address bus. When the processor does not require the bus for a data =
transfer, it=20
will output address FFFFh, R/!W =3D 1, and BS =3D 0; this is a "dummy =
access" or=20
!VMA cycle. All address bus drivers are made high-impedance when output =
bus=20
available (BA) is high or when TSC is asserted. Each pin will drive one =
Schottky=20
TTL load or four LS TTL loads and 90 pF. </P>
<H2><FONT color=3D#0000ff>DATA BUS (</FONT><A name=3DD0-7><FONT=20

<P>These eight pins provide communication with the system bidirectional =

<P>This indicates the direction of data transfer on the data bus. A low=20
indicates that the MPU is writing data onto the data bus. R/!W is made =
high=20
impedance when BA is high or when TSC is asserted. </P>
<H2><A name=3D!RESET><FONT color=3D#0000ff>!RESET</FONT></A></H2>
<P>A low level on this Schrnitt-trigger input for greater than one bus =
cyde will=20
reset the MPU, as shown in Figure 6. The reset vectors are fetched from=20
locations FFFEh and FFFFh (Table 1) when interrupt acknowledge is true, =
(BA=20
&amp; BS =3D 1). During initial power on, the reset line should be held =
low until=20
the clock input signals are fully operational. </P>
<P>Because the !RESET pin has a Schmitt-trigger input with a threshold =
voltage=20
higher than that of standard peripherals, a simple R/C network may be =
used to=20
reset the entire system. This higher threshold voltage ensures that all=20
peripherals are out ot the reset state before the processor.</P>
<H2><A name=3D!HALT><FONT color=3D#0000ff>!HALT</FONT></A></H2>
<P>A low level on this input pin will cause the MPU to stop running at =
the end=20
of the present instruction and remain halted indefinitely without loss =
of data.=20
When halted, the BA output is driven high indicating the buses are high=20
impedance. BS is also high which indicates the processor is in the halt =
state.=20
While halted, the MPU will not respond to external real-time requests =
(!FIRQ,=20
!IRQ) although !NMI or !RESET will be latched for later response. During =
the=20
halt state, Q and E should continue to run normally. A halted state (BA =
&amp; BS=20
=3D 1) can be achieved by pulling HALT low while !RESET is still low. =

<P>The bus available output is an indication of an internal control =

During recognition of an NMI, the entire machine state is saved on the =

<P>E and Q are the clock signals required by the MC6809E. Q must lead E, =

is, a transition on Q must be followed by a similar transition on E =

falling edge of E, and data will be latched from the bus by the falling =

E. While the Q input is fully TTL compatible, the E input directly =
drives=20
internal MOS circuitry and, thus, requires a high level above normal TTL =
levels.=20
This approach minimizes clock skew inherent with an internal buffer. =

<H2><A name=3DBUSY><FONT color=3D#0000ff>BUSY</FONT></A></H2>
<P>BUSY will be high for the read and modify cycles of a =

indirect=20
or other vector fetch (e.g., jump extended, SWI indirect, etc). </P>
<P>In a multiprocessor system, BUSY indicates the need to defer the=20
rearbitration of the next bus cycle to insure the integrity of the above =

operations. This difference provides the indivisible memory access =
required tor=20
a "test-and-set" primitive, using any one of several read-modify-write=20
instructions.</P>
<P>BUSY does not become active during PSH or PUL operations. A typical=20
