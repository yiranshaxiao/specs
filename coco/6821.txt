 The Dragon and Tandy microcomputers have two Motorola 6821 peripheral
 interface adapters (PIA) mapped into the address space between $FF00 and
 $FF3F. The first of these, PIA-0, is located $FF00-$FF03, and the second,
 PIA-1, is located $FF20-$FF23. The Dragon 64 also has a third PIA at
 $FF04-$FF07 but this is not discussed here.

 Each PIA contains two 8-bit I/O ports, port A and port B, where each port
 and each of the 16 I/O pins are independently programmable as either input
 or output pins. Two control/interrupt lines are also associated with each
 port, allowing one extra input/output pin and one input-only pin per port.
 These pins can trigger an interrupt upon 0->1 or 1->0 transitions, or
 'follow' outputs, and are therefore slightly more sophisticated than simple
 buffers, but can nevertheless be used simply as additional I/O.

 Each port is accessed and controlled through 3 registers. These are the
 peripheral data register (PDR), the data direction register (DDR) and the
 control register (CR). For PIA-0 port A the control register is mapped into
 the CPU address space at $FF01. However, only two memory addresses are used
 for each port and therefore both the PDR and DDR cannot be made available
 simultaneously. Instead bit 2 of the control register must be set or cleared
 to select whether it is the PDR or DDR which is visible at $FF00. This
 applies similarly to port B on PIA-0, and both ports of PIA-1.

 The memory map for the four ports of the Dragon/Tandy is as follows:


  ++---------+-------------------+----------------------------------------++
  || Address | PIA & Register Id |   Description of Dragon/Tandy Usage    ||
  ++---------+-------------------+----------------------------------------++
  ||  $FF00  |  PIA0-A PDR/DDR   | Keyboard and joystick input.           ||
  ||  $FF01  |  PIA0-A CR        | MUX selector.                          ||
  ||         |                   |                                        ||
  ||  $FF02  |  PIA0-B PDR/DDR   | Keyboard input and printer output.     ||
  ||  $FF03  |  PIA0-B CR        | MUX selector and timer interrupt.      ||
  ++---------+-------------------+----------------------------------------++
  ||  $FF20  |  PIA1-A PDR/DDR   | 6-bit DAC, strobe, cassette input.     ||
  ||  $FF21  |  PIA1-A CR        | Cassette relay.                        ||
  ||         |                   |                                        ||
  ||  $FF22  |  PIA1-B PDR/DDR   | VDG register and ROM/sound/busy bits.  ||
  ||  $FF23  |  PIA1-B CR        | Sound enable, cartridge interrupt.     ||
  ++---------+-------------------+----------------------------------------++

 In normal operation the PDR is left visible for each port, with the DDR
 only made visible when necessary during configuration or reconfiguration.

 The format of the port registers is as follows:
  PDR - 8 bits of data as currently being input/output on the device pins.
  DDR - 8 bits, each indicating whether the corresponding PDR bits are for
        input (0) or output (1).

  CR  - bit 7: control line 1 interrupt status (0 = idle, 1 = request)   RO
        bit 6: control line 2 interrupt status (0 = idle, 1 = request)   RO
        bit 5: control line 2 direction (0 = input, 1 = output)          RW
        bit 4: control line 2 mode (0 = 1->0, 1 = 0->1 or 'follow')      RW
        bit 3: control line 2 enable (0 = disable, 1 = enable)           RW
        bit 2: PDR/DDR select (0 = DDR, 1 = PDR)                         RW
        bit 1: control line 1 mode (0 = 1->0, 1 = 0->1)                  RW
        bit 0: control line 1 enable (0 = disable, 1 = enable)           RW
                                                          RO = Read only
                                                          RW = Read/write

 All registers are initialised to 0 upon hardware reset, although a pull-up
 resistor selects the 32K compatible ROM in Dragon 64 (see $FF22 below). Here
 is the complete bit-by-bit description of the Dragon/Tandy PIA connections:

 The MUX outputs are connected to a 2-bit multiplexer that is used to select
 which of the analogue joystick wipers are compared against the DAC output
 value by the comparator. The wipers can be selected as follows:

   00 = right joystick, x wiper
   01 = right joystick, y wiper
   10 = left joystick,  x wiper
   11 = left joystick,  y wiper


 The MUX also selects the current sound source as follows:

   00 = 6-bit DAC
   01 = cassette
   10 = cartridge?
   11 = cartridge?
