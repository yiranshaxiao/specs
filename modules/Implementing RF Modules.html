<h1><center>Implementing RF Modules</center></h1>
<!-- Content of Main Page--> 
      <p>A while ago I bought an RF link pair(which consists of one RF 
transmitter and one RF receiver) for Sparkfun for implementation in one 
of my client's products. I wanted to try out RF because it was cheaper 
than bluetooth. And by cheaper I mean A LOT cheaper. A bluetooth module 
would have cost me around $40 and a single RF receiver costs around $4. I
 had a lot of problems when I first started using the RF modules but 
after weeks of struggling with the RF modules , I managed to perfect it.
 This tutorial is meant to teach you how to use the RF link pair and 
help you out if you run into trouble with them.</p>
  
      <p>This tutorial helped me out a bit - <a href="http://winavr.scienceprog.com/example-avr-projects/running-tx433-and-rx433-rf-modules-with-avr-microcontrollers.html">http://winavr.scienceprog.com/example-avr-projects/running-tx433-and-rx433-rf-modules-with-avr-microcontrollers.html</a> . I will try to go into more detail than that tutorial and make it easier to understand.</p>
  
      <p>First off, this tutorial is for the ATmega168 microcontroller, 
produced by Atmel. For other AVR microcontrollers you might need to do a
 little modifications to the code. Also this code will use the C 
language , using the GCC compiler. Enough of introduction, lets begin 
the tutorial:</p>
   
      <p> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">Radio Frequency (RF) communication 
has a ton of applications. It can be used in robots, home automation, 
special effects, or in any application that needs the wireless transfer 
of data. The data transfer speed varies based on the receiver and 
transmitter , but the ones that I will be using throughout the rest of 
the tutorial are rated for 2400 baud, or 300 bytes per second. In the 
real world, with all the electrical interference, I get around 240 bytes
 per second. However, since half of the 240 bytes per second is used for
 encoding, I really can only do 120 bytes of data a second. Sparkfun 
says the range of the RF link is 500 ft. In reality the range is closer 
to 250 feet .We will deal with encoding and data transmission later on.</p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">The RF link consists of one RF 
transmitter and one RF receiver. Make sure the transmitter and receiver 
are both for the same frequency. The transmitter can be bought here : <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8945">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8945</a> . The receiver can be bought here: <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8947">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8947</a></p>
     
           <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">Transmitter looks like this:                  <img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/08945-02-L_i_ma.html" width="76" height="76"></p>
   
      <p style="text-align: left;">The receiver has more pins and looks like this:                <img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/08948-02-L_i_ma.html" width="72" height="72"></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">Once you have obtained the 
transmitter and receiver its time to understand what is the function of 
each pin. Your RF transmitter and receiver will look like one of the 
following pictures :</p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Picture1.jpg" width="244" height="183"> or like <img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/RX433_TX433.html" width="291" height="144"></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">Both of the above pairs of RF links 
have the exact same pins and the exact same stuff. That means that they 
are virtually identical to each other in both appearance and function.  
You need one of the above pairs for this tutorial. </p>
  
      <p> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">I will summarize the datasheets of 
the receiver and transmitter and write the most important information 
that you would need to know about the RF transmitter and receiver. Also 
you should note that a 23cm(around 9 inches) Antenna is recommended on 
both of them - just connect any piece of 23 cm long to the Antenna pin.</p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Transmitter: </b></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">Datasheet - <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/MO-SAWR.pdf">http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/MO-SAWR.pdf</a></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">The transmitter has 4 pins and a diagram is included to show pin function. </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Picture5-1.png" width="180" height="207">        <img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/08945-02-L_i_ma.jpg" width="181" height="181"></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">The transmitter can be powered by any
 voltage(Vcc) between 1.5V and 12V. The higher the voltage , the 
stronger the RF signal becomes. Just make sure not to exceed 12V because
 if you do the transmitter will break, which is bad. The data that the 
microcontroller will be sending will go into the pin labeled "Data In" 
.We also learn in the datasheet that the transmitter needs 20 
milliseconds to start up.</p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Receiver: </b></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">Datasheet- <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/MO-RX3400.pdf">http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/MO-RX3400.pdf</a></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">The receiver has 8 pins and the datasheet also provides us with a diagram.</p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Picture5-2.png" width="270" height="208">         <img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/08948-02-L_i_ma.html" width="210" height="210"></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">The receiver needs between 4.5V and 
5.5V to power it. This means we will be feeding the Vcc pin of the 
receiver ( the pin that you use to power up the receiver) a regulated 5V
 supply. The receiver will output any data it receives through Pin 2 , 
which is labeled "Digital Data Output". Pin 3, labeled "Linear 
Output/Test" is for testing out the receiver, and we will not be using 
it at all. It takes the receiver around 30 milliseconds to start up. </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Introduction to the Data Transmission</b></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">As you know by know data is sent into
 the RF transmitter and then the RF receiver receives that exact data 
that was sent and sends the data out. In other words, the RF transmitter
 has DataIn and the RF receiver has DataOut.  The data protocol that we 
will be using when sending and receiving is called UART. This tutorial 
has some great information on UART  - <a href="http://narobo.com/microcontroller_uart.shtml">http://www.societyofrobots.com/microcontroller_uart.shtml</a></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">One of the few things we need to set 
with UART is the baud rate. This is basically the data transmission 
rate. If we look at the RF transmitter and receiver specs we see that 
the maximum baud rate is 4800. We're going to play on the safe side and 
use one baud rate lower than 4800 , which is 2400. Using a baud rate of 
2400 means that we get a maximum of 2400 bits per second which is equal 
to 300 bytes per second. Like I said before, you really end up getting 
only 240 bytes per second.</p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">The real transmission rate of 240 
bytes per second is further bogged down to 120 bytes of data a second 
because of encoding. Since there is a ton of electrical noise and radio 
frequency noise in most urban environment , you need something called 
encoding to filter out the electrical noise ( the bad stuff) from teh 
data thats being sent ( the good stuff). Encoding is basically "password
 protecting" your data. Think of it as putting a password on your data 
as you send it out through the transmitter. Then when the receiver 
receives any data at all ( this would include electrical noise, radio 
frequency noise, and the correct data) it checks to see if the data has 
the correct "password" sent with it. If it does have the correct 
password then the data is accepted. </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">We will be using the ATmega168 as the
 microcontroller in this tutorial. The microcontroller is responsible 
for sending out the UART data to the transmitter and another 
microcontroller is responsible for receiving the UART data from the 
receiver and filtering out the bad data from the good data (using the 
"password" method of encoding). I use regular C with the GCC compiler on
 the ATmega168. I also like to use the AVRlib libraries , info here: <a href="http://www.mil.ufl.edu/~chrisarnold/components/microcontrollerBoard/AVR/avrlib/docs/html/">http://www.mil.ufl.edu/~chrisarnold/components/microcontrollerBoard/AVR/avrlib/docs/html/ </a>.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">We will get into the technical stuff like the the program code later on in the tutorial.</p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Setting up the 5V Logic Power Supply</b></p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">Since microcontrollers need a 
regulated 5V power source we will make one ourselves. It is extremely 
easy . All you need is a 5V Voltage Regulator chip ( common ones are the
 7805) and if you want you can add two capacitors to smooth out the 
current - its recommended but not necessary. </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;">Heres a schematic and a picture </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Picture7.png" width="232" height="151"></p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
  
      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Creating the Transmitter Circuit </b></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">Creating the transmitter circuit is 
incredibly simple. All it involves is connecting the transmitter DataIn 
pin to the microcontroller DataOut pin ( aka the TXD pin). There is one 
tricky part though . The Vcc of the transmitter should be connected to 
V+ , which is the original unregulated voltage. Remember when we were 
talking about how transmitter strength and range is based on how much 
voltage we give it? Well here is the pin for it. I personally give V+ 
the maximum voltage of 12V because I need as much range as possible.</p>
 
   <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
  
   <p style="text-align: left;">Here is a schematic of the transmitter circuit :</p>
  
   <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Picture8.png" width="563" height="307"></p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Creating the Receiver Circuit</b></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">The Receiver circuit is also fairly 
simple . Just follow the schematic below. DataOut of the RF receiver 
goes to DataIn of the microcontroller ( labeled pin RXD ).</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">This part is responsible for choosing which program is run , the receive or the transmit. </p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Transmitter Code:</b></p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;">In Photovore_v1.c it should have this code</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">This is where we initialize the UART and set the baud rate to 2400 bps.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">This is a pretty complicated piece of 
code. Basically what happens is that when you use the SendByte routine 
you are putting a byte into the UDR register which is in charge of 
sending out bytes out the UART. </p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">My packet consists of four bytes 
being sent with a 2 millisecond delay in between packets. For some 
reason if there is a delay less than 2 milliseconds the RF doesn't work 
properly , so I just added in a 2ms delay. </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Modifying the UART.c AVRlib file </b></p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;">I am a big fan of AVRlib and I wanted to 
use some of AVRlib's uart library but not all of the subroutines. In 
this tutorial the only AVRlib UART routines that we will use is the 
uartInit and the uartSetBaudRate . The only modification that I had to 
do to the UART file was to disable all the UART interrupts so that my 
custom routines ( GetByte and SendByte ) would work properly.</p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">The modified uart.h and uart.c files can be downloaded from here :   
      <a href="http://narobo.com/articles/download/Modified_UART.zip">Modified_UART.zip </a></p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Taking it Further:</b></p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">Wireless RF can be added to almost 
any application. For one project, I needed to communicate from a laptop 
to multiple devices wirelessly. Each device had a receiver and a 
microcontroller. The address of each device was chosen externally by a 
DIP switch. Here are some pictures of the receiver:</p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Receiver.jpg" width="243" height="192">   <img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Photo14-1.jpg" width="284" height="160"></p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">I also created a RF dongle for the RF transmitter. </p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">Here is a 3D model of a preliminary version of it:</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="Implementing%20RF%20Modules_files/Transmitter1-1.jpg" width="293" height="217"></p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
 
  <p style="text-align: left;">You plug in the USB device into a USB 
port. Then you plug in the RF transmitter into a socket. Open up a 
Terminal window and whatever you send out the USB device's virtual 
serial port is sent out the RF transmitter. </p>
 
      <p style="text-align: left;">The RF dongle that I designed will be on sale in about a month. Look for it on the narobo.com Products page.</p>
